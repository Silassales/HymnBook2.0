Psalm 1

l Blessed are they who listen not to evil counsel.
Turn aside from ev'ry thought of sin:
Day and night, the law of God their Maker
Is their joy and meditation, well oflife within.

2 Blessed are they. for as a tree by streams of water
Spreads its leaves in bountiful displays,
Bears and yields its ripened fruit in season—
So shall they in ev‘ry calling prosper all their days.

3 Blessed are they. though sinners like the chaff be scattered,
Blessed are they. though winds ol‘judgcment blow;
From the Lord, upon His righteous servants,
Loving care and tender mercies evermore shall ﬂow.

Psalm 19

God's law is perfect, and converts
The soul in sin that lies;

God's testimony is most sure.
And makes the simple wise.

The statutes of the Lord are right,
And do rejoice the heart;

The Lord’s command is pure. and doth
Light to the eyes impart.

Unspotted is the fear of God,
And doth endure for aye:

The judgements of the Lord are true.
And righteous are alway.

Moreover, they Thy servant warn
How he his life should frame:
A great reward provided is
For them that keep the same.

The words which from my mouth proceed,
The thoughts sent from my heart.
Accept. O Lord. for 'l‘hmt my Strength
And my Redccttter art.

Whose goodness faileth never: With Thee. dear Lord, beside me;
I nothing lack if I am His, Thy rod and staff my comfort still
And He is mine for ever. Thy cross before to guide me.
2 Where streams of living water flow 5 Thou spread'st a table in my sight,
My ransomed soul He leadeth, 0f love beyond all knowing;
And where the verdant pastures grow And 0, what gladness and delight
With food celestial feedeth. From Thy pure cup is ﬂowing!
3 Perverse and foolish oft l strayed, 6 And so through all the length of days
But yet in love He sought me; Thy goodness faileth never:
And on His shoulder gently laid, Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
And home, rejoicing, brought me. Within Thy house for ever.

Psalm [06

Give praise and thanks unto the Lord,
For bountiful is He;

His tender mercy doth endure
Unto eternity.

God's mighty works who can express,
Or show forth all His praise?

Blessed are they that judgement keep,
And justly do always.

Remember me, Lord. with that love
Which Thou to Thine dost bear;
With Thy salvation. O my God.
To visit the draw near:

That I Thy chosen's good may see,
And in their joy rejoice;

And may with Thine inheritance
Exult with cheerful voice.

Blessed be Jehovah. Israel's God.
To all eternity

Let all the people say, ‘Amen’,
Praise to the Lord give ye.

When Iews shall ﬂock with willing feet,

Where holiness and beauty meet.

Not unto us. who are but dust.
But unto Thee is glory due.

Above the clouds, beyond the sky;

Blessed are they that undeﬁled
And straight are in Thy way;
Who in the Lord's most holy law

Do walk, and do not stray.

His statutes are inclined;

And who do seek the living God
With their whole heart and mind.

Such in His ways do walk, and they
Do no iniquity.

Thou hast commanded us to keep
Thy precepts carefully.

GOD: PRAISE 35

1 God who cheered the faithful Joseph

In his lone distress;

He who bade the shepherd Moses
Leave the wilderness,

Summon Israel from the darkness
Of Egyptian night—

He by Moses freed His people
With a hand of might.

2 God who led His chosen people

O'er the Red Sea road,

Through the wilds and over Jordan
To their blest abode.

Scattered them although He loved them—
He will draw them yet,

For His promise to their fathers
He will not forget.

3 God who gave for love of mortals

His belovéd Son,

And received him to His heaven
With the conﬂict won~

God has given us His promise:
Christ will come to reign

O’er His happy ransomed people
In their land again.

Promised through Your living Word.

Sealed in Christ Your precious Sort;

When You gather all in one.

l Hallelujah! raise. oh raise
To our God the song of praise;
All His servants join to sing
Loud the praises of our King.

2 Blesséd be for evermore
That dread Name which we adore;

Round the world His praise be sung

Through all lands, in every tongue.

3 O’er all nations God alone,
Higher than the heav’ns His throne:
Who is like to God Most High,
Inﬁnite in majesty?

4 Yet to view the heav'ns I-Ie bends,
Yea. to earth He condescends;
Passing by the rich and great
For the low and desolate.

5 He can raise the poor to stand
With the princes of the land;
Wealth upon the needy shower,
Set the meanest high in power.

5'3

He the broken spirit cheers
Turns to joy the mourner's teats:
Such the wonder of His ways:
Praise His name—for ever praise.

True and righteous all His ways;
Praise our God, all ye that fear Him,
Praise the Lord. His servants, praise.
Come. ye saints. with joy and gladness
For the marriage feast prepare;
Purged from all their sins. the blesséd
Robes of righteousness shall wear.

Coming down to earth from heaven
New Jerusalem we see:

God shall dwell with man for ever.
His own people they shall be.

God shall wipe away all sorrow,
Former things will pass away,

Lit for ever by God’s presence,
Earth shall glow in endless day.

w

Come, Lord Jesus, come now quickly:
Open soon the Book of Life:
Bring thy judgements, and thy blessings:
End the years of tears and strife.
Worthy is the Lamb that liveth,
Who through death the vict’ry won;
Blessing. honour, strength and riches
Be to him. God’s conqu’ring Son.

1 Hark, my soul. how everything
Strives to serve our bounteous King:
Each a double tribute pays;
Sings its part. and then obeys.

2 Nature’s chief and sweetest choir
Him with cheerful notes admire;
Chanting every day their lauds,
While the grove their song applauds.

3 Wake! for shame, my sluggish heart,
Wake! and gladly sing thy part:
Learn of birds, and springs, and ﬂowers.
How to use thy nobler powers.

4 Call whole nature to thine aid,
Since 'twas He whole nature made;
Join in one eternal song,
Who to one God all belong.

Nations in rage the suffering earth divide:
Yet all unknown l-Ie rules their ceaseless fray.

Immortal, invisible, God only wise,

In light inaccessible hid from our eyes:

Most blesséd, most glorious, the ancient of days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.

Unresting, unhasting. and silent as light,

Nor wanting, nor wasting. Thou rulest in might;

Thy justice like mountains high soaring above,

T 11y clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.

To all life Thou givest, to both great and small:

In all life Then livest, the true life of all;

We blossom and ﬂourish as leaves on the tree,
And wither and perish; but nought ehangcth Thee.

Great Father of glory, pure Father of light.
Thine angels adore Thee, unveiled is their sight;
All laud we would render: 0 help us to see

'Tis only the splendour of light hideth Time.

Thou didst note my working breast,
Thou hast spared me.

Wherefore with my utmost art

And the cream of all my heart
I will bring Thee.

Though my sins against me cried,
Thou didst clear me:

And alone, when they replied.
Thou didst hear me.

Seven whole days, not one in seven,
I will praise Thee:

In my heart, though not in heaven,
I can raise Thee.

Small it is, in this poor sort
To enrol Thee;

E'en eternity's too short

Filled the new-rnade world with light;
And the golden-tressed sun

Caused all day his course to run;

Homéd moon to shine by night

Leading onwards up to man.

In the barren wilderness.

All things living He doth feed.

Let us then, with gladsome mind.
Praise the Lord, for He is kind;

Leading His people through the raging sea;
The waters yielded at our God's command,
And Israel crossed as if upon dryland.
From Egypt's bondage now for ever free.

Sing to the Lord, who for His great Name's praise
Showed men the steadfastness of all His ways.
Through stormy nations Jacob’s seed He led,

In token of the covenant He made,

To set them in the Land in latter days.

Sing to the Lord, who as in days of yore
Will bring His people safe to Jordan's shore.
May they in Christ their true Messiah see.
And low before him gladly bend the knee.
To dwell in Abr'ham’s land for evermore.

Sing to the Lord, who triumphs gloriously.
When roaring waves become the glassy sea,

And trees of life for ever grow
With mercy crowned.

On Zion’s sacred height

He David's throne maintains,

And glorious with the saints in light
He lives and reigns.

Father, hear the prayer we offer;
Not for ease that prayer shall be,

But for strength that we may ever
Live our lives courageously.

Not for ever in gteen pastures
Do we ask our way to be;

But the steep and rugged pathway
May we tread rejoicingly.

Not for ever by still waters
Would we idly rest and stay;

But would smite the living fountains
From the rocks along our way.

Be our strength in hours of weakness.
In our wanderings be our guide;

Through endeavour. failure, danger.

GOD: PRAYER AND CONFIDENCE 140

Father! we Thy children bless Thee
For Thy love on us bestowed;

As our Father we address Thee,
Called to be the sons of God:

Wondrous was Thy love in giving
Jesus for our sins to die:

Wondrous was his grace in yielding
To the great behest from high.

Now the sprinkled blood has freed us
On we go toward our rest;

Through the desert daily lead us,
With Thy constant favour blest.

By Thy word our footsteps guiding,
Lead us in the way of life;

Still our daily food providing.
Help us in the worldly strife.

Though our pilgrimage be dreary,
This is not our resting place;
Shall we of the way be weary
When we see the Master's face?
No; by faith anticipating.
In this hope our souls rejoice;
We. his promised advent waiting.
Long to hear his welcome voice.

1 God is love: His mercy brightens
All the path in which we rove;
Though the darkness sometimes frightens,
God is wisdom, God is love.

2 Time and change are busy ever,
Man decays and ages move;
But His mercy waneth never—
God is wisdom, God is love.

3 E’en the hour that darkest seemeth
Will Hi5 changeless goodness prove;
From die mist I-Iis brightness streameth—v
God is wisdom, God is love.

4 He with earthly cares entwineth
Hope and comfort from above;
Everywhere His glory shineth—
God is wisdom, God is love.

God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;

He plants His footsteps in the sea.
And rides upon the storm.

N

Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-failing skill.

He treasures up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign Will.

U]

Ye fearful saints. fresh courage take,
The clouds ye so much dread

Are big with mercy, and will break
In blessings on your head.

His purposes will ripen fast.
Unfolding every hour:

The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the ﬂower.

U‘

Blind unbelief is sure to err.
And scan His work in vain;

God is His own interpreter,
And He will make it plain.

The temple courts were dark;
The lamp was burning dim
Before the sacred ark;
When suddenly a Voice Divine
Rang through the silence of the shrine.

The priest of Israel. slept:
His watch the Temple child.
The little chite. kept:
And what from Eli's sense was sealed
The Lord to Hannah’s son revealed.

GOD: PRAYER AND CONFIDENCE 147

If thou but suffer God to guide thee,
And hope in Him through all thy ways.
He‘ll give thee strength whate'er betide thee.
And bear thee through the evil days;
Who trust in God's unchanging love
Build on the Rock that naught can move.

What can these anxious cares avail thee,
These never-ceasing moans and sighs?

What can it help, if thou bewail thee
O'er each dark moment as it flies?

Our cross and trials do but press

The heavier for our bitterness.

Only be still, and wait His leisure
In cheerful hope, with heart content
To take whate’er thy Father's pleasure
And all-discerning love hath sent:
No doubt our inmost wants are known
To Him who seeks us for His own.

Sing, pm . and keep His ways unswerving.
So do ine own part faithfully,

And trust His word; though undeserving.
Thou yet shalt find it true for thee:

God never yet forsook in need

The man that trusted Him indeed.

Fill our hearts with heavenly joy,

Comfort wounded hearts that languish;

Let Thy love chase night away.

My heart is pained, nor can it be
At rest, till it ﬁnd rest in Thee.

'Tis mercy all, that Thou hast brought

My heart to seek for peace in Thee;
Yet, while I seek but ﬁnd Thee not,

No peace my wandering mind shall see;
011, when shall all my wanderings end,
And all my steps to Thee-ward tend?

Is there a thing beneath the sun

That strives with Thee my heart to share?
Ah. tear it thence. and reign alone,

The Lord of every motion there!
Then shall my heart from pain be free,
When it hath found repose in Thee.

0 Lord! Thy sovereign aid impart
To save me from low-thoughted care;
Chase this self—will through all my heart,
Through all its latent mazes there;
Make me thy duteous child. that I
Ceaseless may “Abba, Father", cry!

Sang their praise at Jesus’ birth.
Shepherds worshipped as he lay
Cradled in a bed of hay.

Wise men, come from east afar,
Guided to him by a star,

Bowed the holy child to greet,
Laid their treasure at his feet.

Pleasing God with every breath,
In the home of Nazareth,

He in grace and wisdom grew,
To his Heav'nly Father true.
Son of God, he sought to share
Joseph's constant toil and care:
O’er the simple daily round
Truth in meditation found.

Then aside his tools he laid,
And the gospel call obeyed:
Teacher beating tidings glad.
Comforter of sick and sad.

As the prophets, men of old,
Spake for God and thus foretold,
0ft he fasted, prayed alone,
Ever made God's will his own.

Lamb of God. his life he gave
Men from power of death to save;
Life of love—beyond all price—
]esus, perfect sacriﬁce;

Raised to life at God’s right hand.

Forty days and forty nights
Tempted, and yet undefiled.

When in hunger thou didst say,
“It is written, Man shall live"
(Putting ﬂeshly lust away)
“By the word that God did give."

When the world would make thee king
In the way men ever trod,
Spurnedst thou the unclean thing:
“It is written, Worship God."

4 When the devil tempted thee
With the Scripture wrested sore,
From his toils thou didst break free,
With the Scripture honoured more.

5 Lust of ﬂesh, and lust of eyes.
Pride of life—those dreaded three!

By the Word, made ﬂesh in thee.

Which did strengthen Thy dear Son,

His will through priest and patriarch was shown;
In type and shadow. future things were promised.
Which found their substance in the Firstborn Son.

2 Angels, who serve the heirs of God’s salvation.
Are not to be compared with His own Son;
Who in our form. and knowing our temptations,
Was crowned with glory, when his work was done.

3 Our great High Priest, our King. our intercessor.
Shows his compassion when we oft-times stray:
His sacriﬁce brings grace for each transgressor
And gives us boldness when to God we pray.

4 Let us hold fast: "Refuse not him that speaketh!”
Let us have faith, our witness never cease:
Make straight the path, go forth, and win the contest;
Bear his reproach, and ﬁnd in him our peace.

How long. 0 heavenly Bridegroom.
How long wilt thou delay?
And yet how few are grieving.
That thou dost absent stay;
How many have their portion
And calling high forgot;
And seek for ease and glory
Where thou. their Lord, art not.

Oh! wake thy slumbering virgins,
Send forth the solemn cry!

Let all thy saints repeat it:
“The Bridegroom draweth nigh!"

May all our lamps be burning,
Our loins well girded be:

Each longing heart preparing
With joy to welcome thee.

At his humble birth.

In his Father's power,
Saints will sing his praises
Then and evermore.

And Thy law fulfil.

With justice, mercy. truth—

While stars maintain their stations.
And moons renew their youth.

Upon the fruitful earth;

And love, joy, hope. like ﬂowers.
Spring in his path to birth.

The known and unknown worlds obey,
Now give the kingdom to Thy Son,
Extend his power, exalt his throne.

2 The sceptre well becomes his hand:
And kings shall bow to his command:
His justice shall avenge the poor,
And pride and rage prevail no more.

3 With power he vindicates the just
And treads oppressors in the dust;
His worship and his fear shall last
Till sin and death from earth have passed.

4 The saints shall ﬂourish in his days,
And wear the robes of joy and praise;
Peace like a river from his throne
Shall ﬂow to nations yet unknown.

0h! pray ye for Zion, though sad and forsaken,
Though scorned and derided, despised and forlorn;
The truth of Jehovah. our God, is unshaken.
I-Ier night shall but usher a glorious morn.

Oh! labour for Zion. though now, in her blindness,
She knows not her Saviour, Messiah, and Lord;

Yet. guided by mercy, the life-tones of kindness
Shall win her dull ear to the voice of his word.

0h! watch ye for Zion; the day-spring is breaking.
l-ler night has been gloomy, but shortly will end;
Her long-promised Shepherd his lost sheep is seeking,
The heart of the obdurate nation will bend.

0h! hope ye for Zion; salvation is nearing,
And brighter than mom’s roseate glow shall be seen.
The great Sun of Righteousness with his appearing,
And beams of his glory shall gladden the scene.

Rejoice ye for Zion! Jehovah has spoken;
Jerusalem’s outcasts shall yet be restored;

The bonds of the fetter-bound slave shall be broken,
And Judah set free at the word of the Lord.

To faithful Abram‘s seed.

That Jacob's race shall be restored
To favour and to joy.

When this shall be fulﬁlled;
And Thy dear Son, with mighty power.
To Israel be revealed.

And sound his mercy all divine

Lo. the sacred herald stands;
Welcome news to Zion bearing,
Zion long in hostile lands:
Mourning captive,
Mourning captive,
God Himself will loose thy bands.

2 Has thy night been long and mournful?
All thy friends unfaithful proved?
Have thy foes been proud and scornful.
By thy sighs and tears unmoved?
Cease thy mourning.
Cease thy mourning,
Zion still is well-beloved.

3 God, thy God, will now restore thee,
He Himself appears thy friend;
All thy foes shall ﬂee before thee.
Here their boasts and triumphs end.
Great deliv’rance.

All thy warfare now is past,

Of our life‘s wild restless sea
Day by day his sweet voice soundeth,
Saying. ‘Christian, follow me.’

2 As of old apostles heard it
By the Galilean lake,
Turned from home and toil and kindred,
Leaving all for his dear sake.

3 Jesus calls us from the worship
Of the vain world's golden store,
From each idol that would keep us,
Saying. ‘Christian, love me more.‘

4 In our joys and in our sorrows.
Days of toil and hours of ease,
Still he calls. in cares and pleasures.
'Christian. love me more than these.’

Give our hearts to thy obedienCE.

Hope. and be undismayed;
God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears:
God shall lift up thy head.

2 Put thou thy trust in God.
In duty’s path go on;
Walk in His strength with faith and hope
50 shall thy work be done.

3 When He makes bare His arm,
Who shall His work withstand?
When He His people‘s cause defends,
Who then shall stay His hand?

To choose and to command:
With wonder filled. thou then shalt own
How wise, how strong His hand!

He gently Clears thy way;
Wait thou His time, so shall the night
Soon end in joyous day.

A length of happy days:

In pleasant paths to tread;

Fill thy weak soul with vain alarm:
His strength shall bear thy spirit up,
And brace thy heart and nerve thine arm.

Take up thy cross. nor heed the shame.
And let thy foolish pride be still;

With joy and not with fear.

In the bud of early Spring-time.
In due days of early youth,
When the heart is fresh and tender.
Lord. impress us with Thy truth.
Teach us how to shun the evil,
Teach us how to love the right;
Ere the days of evil sadden.
Lead, oh lead us in the light.

In the days of Summer help us
To devote our strength to Thee;
May the fruit we hear be precious,
Yielded gratefully and free.
Fruits of holiness, refreshing,
Strengthening others in the strife—
Fruit that proves to all a blessing
Leading on to endless life.

In the days of Autumn may there

Be rich sheaves of golden grain;
Plenteous stores of wisdom garnered.

Thoughts divine that cause no pain;
Rich experience of Thy mercy.

Large remembrance of Thy love.
Grant, 0 God, that in the Autumn

We may all Thy goodness prove.

And when Winter comes—oft dreary.
Seeming far away from Spring.

When health fails and men grow weary,
Yet may we be glad and sing:

Glad because of coming glory,
When for ever troubles cease;

For we know the blessed story
That there shall be endless peace.

1 Praise to Him by whose high favour
Saving truth has reached our ears!

May its sweet reviving savour
Fill our beans and calm our fears.

2 Truth! how sacred is the treasure!
Teach us, Lord. its worth to know;
Vain the hope. and short the pleasure
Which from other sources flow.

3 May the truth we have been hearing
Wake response in every heart;
In the day of Christ‘s appearing.
Grant us. gracious Lord, a part.
