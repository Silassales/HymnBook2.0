l [0 children. hither do ye come,
And unto me give ear;
I shall you teach to understand
How ye the Lord should fear,]

2 [What man is he that life desires,
To see good would live long?
Thy lips refrain from speaking guile,
And from ill words thy tongue.]

3 [Depart from ill, do good, seek peace,
Pursue it earnestly:
God's eyes are on the just, His ears
Are open to their cry.]

4 [The face of God is set against
Those that do wickedly.
That from the earth He may cut off
Their evil memory.]
