1 [Rest in the Lord, and patiently
Wait for Him; do not fret
For him who, prospâ€™ring in his way.
Success in sin doth get.]

2 [Do thou from anger cease, and wrath
See thou forsake also:
Fret not thyself in any wise
That evil thou shouldst do.]

3 [For those that evil doers are
Shall be cut off and fall:
But those that wait upon the Lord
The earth inherit shall.]

4 [For yet a little while, and then
The wicked shall not be:
His place thou shalt consider well,
But it thou shalt not see.]

5 [But by inheritance the earth
The meek ones shall possess:
They also shall delight themselves
in an abundant peace.]
