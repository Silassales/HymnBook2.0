1 [High in the heavens, eternal God,
Thy goodness in full glory shines;
Thy truth shall break through every cloud
That veils and darkens Thy designs.]

2 [For ever firm Thy justice stands
As mountains their foundations keep;
Wise are the wonders of Thy hands;
Thy judgements are a mighty deep.]

3 [My God. how excellent Thy grace,
Whence all our hope and comfort springs!
The sons ofAdam in distress
Fly to the shadow ofThy wings.]

4 [Life. like a fountain rich and free,
Springs from the presence of the Lord;
And in Thy light our souls shall see
The glories promised in Thy word.]
