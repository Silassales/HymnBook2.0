1 [God is our refuge and our strength,
In straits a present aid;
Therefore, although the earth remove.
We will not be afraid:]

2 [Though hills amidst the seas be cast:
Though waters roaring make,
And troubled be: yea, though the hills
By swelling seas do shake.]

3 [A river is. whose streams make glad
The city of our God;
The holy place wherein the Lord
Most high hath His abode;]

4 [God in the midst of her doth dwell,
Nothing shall her remove;
The Lord to her a helper will.
And that right early. prove.]
