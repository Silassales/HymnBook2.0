1 [As pants the hart for cooling streams.
When heated in the chase
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,
And Thy refreshing grace.]

2 [For T hee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine:
O when shall I behold Thy face.
Thou Majesty divine?]

3 [Why restless. why cast down, my soul?
Hope still. and thou shalt sing
The praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy healthâ€™s eternal spring.]
