1 [For evil-doers fret thou not
Thyself unquietly.
Nor do thou envy bear to those
That work iniquity.]

2 [For even like unto the grass,
Soon he cut down shall they;
And, like the green and tender herb.
They wither shall away.]

3 [Set thou thy trust upon the Lord,
And be thou doing good;
And so thou in the land shalt dwell,
And verily have food.]

4 [Delight thyself in God; He’ll give
Thine heart's desire to thee.
Thy way to God commit. Him trust,
It bring to pass shall He.]

5 [And like unto the light, He shall
'I‘hy righteousness display:
And He thy judgement shall bring forth
Like noon-tlde of the day.]
