1 [God is my strong salvation.
What foe have I to fear?
In darkness and temptation
My light. my help is near:
Though hosts encamp around me.
Firm to the fight I stand!
What terror can confound me,
With God at my right hand?]

2 [Place on the Lord reliance;
My soul, with courage wait:
His truth be thine affiance
When faint and desolate.
His mightthy heart shall strengthen.
His love thy joy increase:
Mercy thy days shall lengthen;
The Lord will give thee peace.]
