1 [Lord. Thee I'll praise with all my heart.
Thy wonders all proclaim:
In Thee. Most High, I’ll greatly joy,
And sing unto Thy name.]

2 [God shall endure for aye: He cloth
For judgement set His throne;
In righteousness to judge the world,
Justice to give each one.]

3 [God also will a reluge be
For those that are oppressed:
A refuge will He he in times
of trouble to distressed.]

4 [And they that know Thy name, in Thee
Their conﬁdence will place:
For Thou hast not forsaken them
That truly seek Thy face.]
