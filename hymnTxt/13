1 [To Thee I lift my soul;
0 Lord I trust in Thee:
My God, let me not be ashamed,
Nor triumph foes o'er me.]

2 [Let none that wait on Thee
Be put to shame at all;
But those who without cause transgress,
Let shame upon them fall.]

3 [Show me Thy ways, 0 Lord:
Thy paths. 0 teach Thou me:
And do Thou lead me in ’l‘hy truth.
Therein my teacher be.]

4 [Thy tender mercies, Lord,
Remember now, I pray,
And loving-kindnesses; for they
Have been of old for aye.]

5 [My sins and faults of youth
Do Thou, O Lord. forget;
After Thy mercy think on me.
And forThy goodness great.]
