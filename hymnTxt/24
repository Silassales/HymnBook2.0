1 [O send Thy light forth and Thy truth;
Let them be guides to me.
And bring me to Thine holy hillâ€”
E'en where Thy dwellings be.]

2 [Then will I to God's altar go
To God my chiefest joy
Yea. God, my God. Thy name to praise
My harp I will employ.]

3 [Why art thou then cast down. my soul?
What should discourage thee?
And why with vexing thoughts art thou
Disquicted in me?]

4 [Still trust in God; for Him to praise
Good cause I yet shall have;
He of my count'nance is the health,
My God that me doth save.]
