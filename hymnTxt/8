1 [God's law is perfect, and converts
The soul in sin that lies;
God's testimony is most sure.
And makes the simple wise.]

2 [The statutes of the Lord are right,
And do rejoice the heart;

The Lord’s command is pure. and doth
Light to the eyes impart.]

3 [Unspotted is the fear of God,
And doth endure for aye:
The judgements of the Lord are true.
And righteous are alway.]

4 [Moreover, they Thy servant warn
How he his life should frame:
A great reward provided is
For them that keep the same.]

5 [The words which from my mouth proceed,
The thoughts sent from my heart.
Accept. O Lord. for 'l‘hmt my Strength
And my Redccttter art.]
