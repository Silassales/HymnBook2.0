1 [0 Lord. our Lord, how excellent
Thy name on earth is known;

Thy glory in the ﬁrmament,
How wonderfully shown!]

2 [When l behold the heavens on high,
The work ofThy right hand,
The moon and stars amid the sky,
Thy lights in every land—] 

3 [Lord, what is man that Thou should‘st deign
On him Thy love to place.

As king and priest with Christ to reign.
And see him face to face?]

4 [O Lord how excellent Thy name!
How manifold Thy ways!

Let time Thy saving truth proclaim.
Eternity Thy praise.]
