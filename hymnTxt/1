l [Blessed are they who listen not to evil counsel.
Turn aside from ev'ry thought of sin:
Day and night, the law of God their Maker
Is their joy and meditation, well oflife within.]

2 [Blessed are they. for as a tree by streams of water
Spreads its leaves in bountiful displays,
Bears and yields its ripened fruit in season—
So shall they in ev‘ry calling prosper all their days.]

3 [Blessed are they. though sinners like the chaff be scattered,
Blessed are they. though winds ol‘judgcment blow;
From the Lord, upon His righteous servants,
Loving care and tender mercies evermore shall ﬂow.]
